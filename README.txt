Chinese version of Wanikani
==
Wanikani is a great way to learn kanji. According to the forums, there's no good app that does what Wanikani does for Chinese. So, here's my attempt at that.

- Individual character data from http://ccdb.hemiola.com/characters/?filter=gb&fields=kDefinition,kMandarin,string, which came from http://www.unicode.org/charts/unihan.html
- Used the GB2312 (6763 characters, which represents 99% of contemporary characters), which is the simplified version used in Mainland China
- Dictionary data from https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cedict
- Frequency data from http://lingua.mtsu.edu/chinese-computing/statistics/char/list.php?Which=MO
- HSK data from http://huamake.com/1to6Lists.htm
